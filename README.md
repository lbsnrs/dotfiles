# @lbsnrs does dotfiles

## Credits

This is just a repo with my public dotfiles based on the excellent
[@holman][1]’s [dotfiles][2]. A great font of inspiration for the stuff
included in the set-defaults.sh  script has been Mathias Bynens’ [.osx][3].

## Usage

I suggest you to simply peek at the scripts and source files and take what you
need but feel free to do otherwise.

Grep for "EDIT THIS LINE" to have a quick look at the things you may need to alter.

What I personally do is clone the repository on my system and symlink the
directory to ~/.dotfiles. Then cd to it and run bin/bootstrap.
